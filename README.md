### :open_file_folder: The Brief:

-   Rebuild my Web App with the React library.

### :hourglass_flowing_sand: Time spent / Deadline:

2 weeks.

### :dart: Goals:

-   Crash course in React and rebuild my [RadioPlayer](https://harry-yates.github.io/radioPlayer/) Project.
-   Make use of Sveriges Radio API.

### :mechanical_arm: Solution:

Nail down the React fundamentals, get to an MPV in a week and integrate new features.

### :man_student: Learnings:

-   React
    -   Installing Create React App and generating the project.
    -   Refactoring elements using JSX.
    -   Creating components.
    -   Adding Keys.
    -   Destructuring arrays and objects.
    -   Working with the useState Hook and useEffect.
    -   Fetch/display data from multiple APIs.
    -   Handling loading states.
    -   Deploying to Git Hub Pages & Netlify.

### :interrobang: Future Improvements:

-   React Router

    -   The App is static, but I ran out of time to implement React Router and set up different routes to pages.

-   Test Driven Development

    -   I could have made better use of the Jest testing platform and React testing library.
    -   Made good use of Strict Mode to follow best practices and flag areas for improvement.

-   Vanilla JS

    -   The project highlighted areas I need to improve on, such as scoping, callbacks, passing functions, short circuiting and array methods.

-   Conditional Operators
    -   ~~I couldn't get all of these operating how I'd like, so if there are less than four songs in the API playlist, the App crashes :grimacing:.~~
    -   :white_check_mark:  Note: Bug fixed using optional chaining.
